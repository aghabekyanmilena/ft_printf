# ft_printf

# Overview
ft_printf is a custom implementation of the standard printf function in C.
It mimics the behavior of printf for the following format specifiers: %c, %s, %p, %d, %i, %u, %x, %X, and %%. It is a part of the 42 project.

# Specifications
Your goal is to write a function, ft_printf(), which behaves like the standard printf.
The project includes handling for various format specifiers, managing output to stdout, and correctly calculating the number of characters printed.

# Requirements
Variadic functions: va_start, va_arg, va_copy, va_end
